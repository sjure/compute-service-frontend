# React Redux frontend for Compute Service


## Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

Local web server will use port 8000 instead of standard React's port 3000 to prevent conflicts with the backend.
